# Rating component

Interactive rating component using HTML, SCSS, React.

# How it works

User chooses a rating from 1 to 5. Upon clicking on the submit button,
a thank you page renders, showing which rating was chosen.
If no rating was chosen, a "You have not selected a rating" is shown instead.

State persists between going back and forward between pages, resets upon refresh.

# What I've learned:

- basics of SASS
- basics of useState
- basics of React Router
- passing props through Router's Link
- using useLocation hook for rendering passed props in Link
